## Traffic lights sequence

1. Try turning the lights on and off in sequence:

1. Now you know how to control the lights individually, and time the pauses between commands, can you create a traffic lights sequence? The sequence goes:

    - Green on
    - Amber on
    - Red on
    - Red and amber on
    - Green on

It's important to think about timing. How long should the lights stay on for at each stage?

Once you have completed the traffic light sequence, you might want to try adding in a button and a buzzer to make an interactive traffic light for a pedestrian crossing.
